SportTracks Fitlog to Garmin Training Center XML converter
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SportTracks can export to its own Fitlog XML based file format. This program is created to convert my running history from SportTracks to Garmin Connect (or later another program or web service)

Releasing the sources as Open Source so maybe others can benefit from it as well.
